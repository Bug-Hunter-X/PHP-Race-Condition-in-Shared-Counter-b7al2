This code suffers from a potential race condition. If multiple processes or threads access and modify the shared resource `$counter` concurrently without proper synchronization mechanisms, the final value of `$counter` might be incorrect.  Each increment operation involves multiple steps (reading the current value, adding 1, and writing the new value back). If another process/thread interferes between these steps, it could lead to data loss or incorrect results. For example, if two processes read `$counter` simultaneously as 0, both increment it to 1, and then write it back, the final value will remain 1 instead of 2.
